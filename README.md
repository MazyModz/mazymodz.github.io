# Dennis' Rants

In this blog you'll find everything from rants about modern software to learning resources and experiments. I'm a game developer
with 10 years of experiance working in Unreal Engine and I also work on my own engines. Most topics will be about software performance
as I am a performance oriented programmer. Modern software is extremely slow and buggy; most programmers have no idea how the 
hardware they are programming works. Hopefully this blog will, however tiny, make a difference in the world to correct that...
